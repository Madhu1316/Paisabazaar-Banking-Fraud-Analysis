# Paisabazaar-Banking-Fraud-Analysis
Paisabazaar, a financial services platform, aims to strengthen its fraud detection system by analyzing customer financial data. This project uses a dataset of 100,000 banking customers to identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate fraudâ€”such as credit card misuse, loan exploitation, or suspicious payment behavior.
